# Test Strategy for TAK LDAP Admin Interface

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the TAK LDAP Admin Interface, focusing on unit tests for the WebUI code.

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests
- Verify the Flask application can be created
- Verify routes are registered
- Verify LDAP connection mocking works

### 2. Authentication Tests
- Test login functionality
- Test logout functionality
- Test session management
- Test authentication requirements for protected routes

### 3. User Management Tests
- Test user listing
- Test user creation
- Test user editing
- Test user deletion
- Test user search functionality

### 4. Group Management Tests
- Test group listing
- Test group creation
- Test group editing
- Test group deletion
- Test group membership management

### 5. API Tests
- Test API endpoints for users
- Test API endpoints for groups
- Test API endpoints for stats
- Test connection testing API

### 6. Error Handling Tests
- Test invalid inputs
- Test LDAP connection failures
- Test authentication failures
- Test authorization failures

## Test Implementation

### Unit Tests
Unit tests will be implemented using pytest and will focus on:
- Testing route handlers
- Testing LDAP interactions (mocked)
- Testing form validation
- Testing authentication and authorization

### Integration Tests
Integration tests will verify:
- End-to-end workflows
- Interactions between components
- Real LDAP interactions (in a test environment)

## Test Execution
Tests will be run:
- During development
- Before merging code
- As part of CI/CD pipeline

## Test Coverage
We aim for:
- High code coverage (>80%)
- Coverage of all critical paths
- Coverage of error handling

## Test Maintenance
Tests will be maintained by:
- Updating tests when functionality changes
- Adding tests for new features
- Reviewing test failures promptly
